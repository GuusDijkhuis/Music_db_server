# Music Database server
This is the code for the music database server. I use the database server for the client connection with the database. The server is build with a Model, controller, routes structure.

If you want to use a own server you can clone this server and add an `.env`.

For more details I send you to [Music Database](https://github.com/GuusDijkhuis/Music_db_client)
